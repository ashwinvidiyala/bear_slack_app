# Bear Slack App

This is a [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/start) that integrates the note
taking app [Bear](https://bear.app/) with [Slack](https://slack.com/).

## To Do
- [ ] Add Slack App usage instructions to this document.
- [ ] DRY out code more.
- [ ] Write tests.
- [ ] Make this a fully functioning app that can be added to the Slack App
  Directory.
- [ ] Address Rubocop violations.
- [ ] Create a simple HTML page that explains this Slack App.
  - If you will do this, make sure to add a "Add to Slack" button.
  - If this isn't the path that you will go down, make this an API-only Rails
    app and remove all the excess bloat. [This
article](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/how-to-make-rails-5-api-only) is a
good starting point.
- [ ] Remove dependence on the [slack-ruby-client
  gem](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-client). It shouldn't be too
hard to do what you're doing here without the overhead of another dependency.
But if it is, keep this gem :)
